# ingest.py â€” robust & low-memory index builder for VIC councils
# - Uses sitemaps + manual seeds + light BFS crawl
# - Embeds incrementally in small batches (low RAM)
#
# Examples:
#   python3 ingest.py --only "Wyndham City Council" --limit-pages 40 --max-chunks 600 --batch 12
#   python3 ingest.py  # build all councils from councils.json with safe defaults
